And now we'll use asyncData to pull user detail based on the `id` url-parameter.

Again, we'll use the same `axios-proxy` plugin to return a promise.

```javascript
// pages/_id.vue

asyncData ({app, params}) {

  console.log('asyncData called')
  return app.$axiosClient.getData('/users/'+params.id)
    .then(response => {
      // set data in local variable
      return { user: response.data }
  })
}
```

Alternatively, you can write the same with **async/await**.

```javascript
// pages/_id.vue
async asyncData ({app, params}) {
  let response = await app.$axiosClient.getData('/users/'+params.id)

  // set data in local variable
  return { user: response.data }
}
```

While you have set the local data with user detail, make sure to check out terminal console to see that asyncData is called only after validate hook has passed.

In the dynamic route parameter, try using `id` that doesn't exist, and you'll see that the validation will fail and lifecycle sequence is terminated.
