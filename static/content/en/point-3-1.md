# validate()

Validate hook does exactly what the term suggests, it validates parameter defined in dynamic routes. In Nuxt, this dynamic route would look something like this, `pages/_id.vue`

`{params}` key can access the value of `_id` from dynamic route, `pages/_id.vue`.

Use this hook to verify the existence or integrity of the dynamic parameter.
